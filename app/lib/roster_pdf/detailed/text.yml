    - "<b>America's Boating Club®</b> is a nation-wide boating organization. We learn together, boat together, and help each other and other boaters on the water and on land. Our members learn boating skills, engage with boating friends, and connect with the boating community."
    - "<b>America's Boating Club® – Birmingham Squadron</b> is a unit of United States Power Squadrons® (USPS) serving Oakland County, Michigan and the surrounding areas. 2018 marks a new era for USPS as we emphasize our important role as serving all boaters with our new name:<br><b>America's Boating Club®</b>."
    - "<b>America's Boating Club®</b> is the largest nonprofit organization in the world devoted to boating safety and education, and is composed of people interested in learning and sharing knowledge about boats, both sail and power. We are not a government organization, but close ties are maintained with the Coast Guard and state boating agencies in our pursuit of better, safer boating."
    - "<b>America's Boating Club® – Birmingham Squadron</b> ('BPS' or 'Birmingham Squadron') is one of 17 squadrons in USPS District 9, which covers Michigan and northern Indiana."
  sections:
    Our Members: "Our membership is composed of power boaters and sailors. About two-thirds of our members own boats, most of which are home-ported everywhere from Southeast and other portions of Michigan to other parts of Oakland County. However, boat ownership is not required for membership in Birmingham Squadron."
    Public Service: "We provide basic and advanced boating education to the general public and to our members. Another public service activity is our Vessel Safety Check, in which trained examiners will, at the request of the boat owner, check a boat for required equipment and award a Coast Guard-recognized Vessel Safety Check compliance decal to boats that pass the inspection. To arrange for a vessel safety check, contact <u>vsc@bpsd9.org</u>. Birmingham Squadron and other squadrons provide chart update information to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the Cooperative Charting Program. For information on current public education, vessel safety checks and other activities, check out our web site at <u>www.bpsd9.org</u>."
    Education: "Each year, Birmingham Squadron offers a broad range of boating classes ranging from basic skills, to subjects such as engine maintenance, weather, sail, and cruise planning, right up to celestial navigation. Details and class schedules may be found on the Squadron website at <u>www.bpsd9.org</u> . All instructors are USPS-certified; America's Boating Course instructors are dually certified by USPS and DNR."
    Social Activities: "Birmingham Squadron members participate in regular social events throughout the year. These include summer boating rendezvous, mainly in the waters around Lake St. Clair, and large and small get-togethers where we share boating and other experiences. Information on individual events is posted monthly on the Birmingham Squadron website at <u>www.bpsd9.org</u> ."
    Meetings: "Meet us at monthly meetings held on the 2nd Tuesday of each month at <b>Kerby's Koney Island at 5407 Crooks Rd, Troy, MI</b> beginning at 1900, with dinner off the menu and camaraderie beginning at 1830. In addition to a short business meeting, we enjoy a presentation on important and interesting boating topics by outside speakers. Meeting information is on the web site at <u>www.bpsd9.org</u>."
flags:
  ensign: "The USPS ensign features a red canton with 13 white stars around a fouled anchor. The body of the flag contains 13 vertical blue and white stripes. The USPS ensign, which may be flown in U.S. waters in place of the U.S. national ensign, was first flown in 1915."
  burgee: "Our squadron burgee, first flown in 1964, is a pennant design with a white seahorse and white stars on a field of blue. The seahorse represents the original home of the squadron, The Open Hunt Club of Bloomfield Hills. The three stars represent the three neighboring Power Squadrons: Detroit, Grosse Pointe and Mt. Clemens, that provided a majority of the charter members and invaluable assistance. The blue field represents the Great Lakes and Michigan waters. The burgee was designed by the daughter of Richard W. Shirk, who became our 5th Commander."

education:
  introduction:
    - "<b>America’s Boating Club – Birmingham Squadron</b> enjoys a well-earned reputation as a leader in safe boating education. Each year, our award-winning education program offers a full-range of USPS classes with the goal of offering all classes within a 2-year timespan. In addition, Birmingham Squadron provides multiple monthly two-hour seminars on current boating topics."
    - "In Michigan, you need boating safety education if you were born after <b>June 30, 1996</b>, and will be operating a vessel in Michigan. Most PWC operators also need education. Bordering states and Ontario have similar requirements. Birmingham offers a broad range of courses beginning with America’s Boating Course™, and Birmingham instructors are certified to teach the Michigan course and to issue the Michigan Boater Education Card that must be carried by most boaters in Michigan, Ontario and most states. Birmingham Squadron also teaches the Canadian Pleasure Craft Operator Card course. If you wish to add to your marine knowledge and skills, we offer classes in boat handling, near-shore and off-shore navigation, marine electronics, radio, and radar, and special subjects such as weather, engine maintenance and sail. Instruction is offered in 2-hour seminars, on-line or in class with instructors. In addition, the USPS Boat Operator on-the-water Certification program is recognized by many charter companies and some foreign countries as evidence of boater competence."
    - "Safe Boating Education saves you money. The USPS Boat Insurance Program rewards members for their dedication and passion for on-the-water safety by providing reduced insurance premiums. On top of low base rates, USPS Boat Insurance customers can reduce their premium even further, up to 23%, through completion of various USPS advanced courses. And completing boat operator certification can add to these discounts as much as an additional 15%, for a total discount of 38%."
    - "Our class schedule changes with the seasons. For the most up-to-date information on upcoming class opportunities, check out our web site at <u>www.bpsd9.org/courses</u>."
    - "<b>USPS University Seminars</b> USPS University is here with new programs targeted to a range of boaters and types of boating. The hallmark of this concept is the Seminar Series. These short, 2-hour seminars are targeted to specific topics and needs such as Trailering, VHF Radio, Anchoring, Radar and many others. Many seminars provide an introduction to the topic being taught as well as credits toward the Boat Operator Certification program, and credit toward elective courses."
    - "Birmingham Squadron presents seminars each month. Regular seminars are taught on Saturday mornings at the West Marine Store on Big Beaver Road in Troy, Michigan, and at the Great Lakes Yacht Club. All seminars are open to members and to the public."
    - "For the schedule of upcoming seminars and registration information, go to our Squadron Web Site at <u>www.bpsd9.org/seminars</u>."
